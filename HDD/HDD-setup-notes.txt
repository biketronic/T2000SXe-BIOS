With bios mod:

Requirements: Virtualbox on linux
External HDD adapter - I used ESATA -> SATA - 2.5" IDE adapter, direct USB did not work for me.

Setup and run Virtualbox with a real external drive:
    sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/SDG500MB.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdg (for example)
    sudo VirtualBox
    Then Create a new virtual machine and assign Dos 6.22 FDD and the e.g. SDG500MB.vmdk as the hdd
    Now Start the virtual machine. Reset and F12 are useful to check for boot errors. It should boot the FDD to a dos prompt.

Set up hdd from scratch:
        linux - fdisk /dev/sdg (for example):
        Delete partition (d)
        Expert mode (x)
        Cylinders 1024 (c 1024)
        Heads 16 (h 16)
        Sectors/track 63 (s 63)
        Return (r)
        Verify (v) should complain there is no partition
        Write dos parition (o)
        Print partitions (p) should be no patritions
        Create partition (n)
        Start point 2048, end point 1032192 (1024x63x16)
        Change Type (t)
        to FAT16 (6)
        Verify (v) should complain about not all space used
        Write (w)
        
        Booting /dev/sdg (for example) in virtualbox and
        Fdisk - Delete partition and create 500MB Partition
        Fdisk - Set partition Active
        Format c: /s
        fdisk /mbr

        Copy dos across if you like:
        c:
        mkdir dos
        cd dos
        copy A:*.*

        May need to redo CHS in linux fdisk expert mode, then redo partitions in virtualbox etc as above.

        
GOTCHAS:

1. virtualbox dos fdisk problems:
1.1 shows a strange MB size value (does not match intended size)
    a. shows size of another disk? 
        ai. use of the same vmdk file for 2 disks at e.g. /dev/sdg. Need a new vmdk for each disk
        aii. delete all partitions with dos fdisk and recreate 500MB partition.
    b. shows a disk size (i.e. actual size) larger than 504MB? it's normal, but can't use >504MB
1.2 shows non-dos partition
    a. Linux fdisk /dev/sdg -> t 6 (change hdd type to FAT16)
2 Does not boot c: in virtualbox
    Check partition type is PRI DOS in DOS fdisk -> 1.2.a
    It won't boot on the T2000SXe, if it won't boot in virtualbox by the way.


2. T2000SXe does not boot

2.1 Stops on memory test display with _ 
    This means there is no HDD at all.
    Check the jumper on the CF adapter, should jump the 2 closest pins to the IDE interface
    I.e. master setting not slave

2.2 Stops after memory test (cleared screen)
2.2.1 Shows _ only
        fdisk /mbr in virtualbox seems to fix this

2.2.2 Shows "Disk IO Error"
        You are using DOS 7.1. Try DOS 6.22

2.2.3 Shows "non system disk or disk error"
        Bad partition information
        Set up from scratch (3)
2.2.4 Shows "missing operating system"
        Bad partition information
        Set up from scratch (3)
2.2.5 Shows " invalid system disk"
        DOS 7.1 used. Try DOS 6.22
2.2.6 Shows "place sytem disk in drive"
        Deleted partition?
        BIOS set to No HDD?        

2.2.7 but it boots in virtualbox!
        May need to re-run fdisk and enter cylinders again.
        linux - fdisk /dev/sdg (for example):
        Expert mode (x)
        Cylinders 1024 (c 1024)
        Heads 16 (h 16)
        Sectors/track 63 (s 63)
        Return (r)
        Write (w)

        Booting /dev/sdg (for example) in virtualbox and
        Fdisk - Delete partition and create 500MB Partition
        Fdisk - Set partition Active
        Format c: /s
        fdisk /mbr
      

ANYDRIVE:
ANYDRIVE says it only supports max 504MB HDDs.
But it could be useful for 0-504MB HDD sizes
as the BIOS options are limited to pre-set values.

Anydrive can be installed using Virtualbox.
e.g.
ANYDRIVE 0 1024 16 63
Then boot virtualbox F12 select 1 IDE HDD quickly press left shift
anydrive will say "boot from a:"
then fdisk/format c:/s
The advantage is it shows anydisk before an error so you can see that
the HDD is being read on the T2000SXe
It's probably the same as getting past the memory test screen.
It is not required at all.
fdisk /mbr removes it.

EZ-DRIVE:
EZ-DRIVE supposedly needs 4MB ram so I haven't tried it. (I have 2MB)


NOTE Without BIOS mod:
T2000SXe Briefly flashes HDD led then says
Place system disk in drive
Press any key when ready
!No anydrive message if anydrive installed! It is not even reading the HDD.
