Create VMDK that points to actual 120MB hdd

sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
  -rawdisk /dev/sda

sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /home/eric/VM/Virtualbox/386/120mbg.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdg


sudo VirtualBox

Create new VM using VMDK drive

it boots dos!

Copy anydrive to mounted hdd

run anydrive: parameters

 Model #     Interface   Heads       Cyls.     Sect.   WP Com    LZ   Capacity
MK1722FCV   IDE           8         842        38         0    842     131MB

I used the parameters from the Conner: Quick Reference Guide For Disk Drive Products (Cylinders 980, Heads 5, Sectors 17)


ANYDRIVE parameters
Run ANYDRIVE 0 <Cyl> <Heads> <Sects> ......

ANYDRIVE 0 842 8 38

or

ANYDRIVE 0 823 4 38

or 

ANYDRIVE 0 980 5 17 ???

worked!?
Breifly flashes HDD then says
Place system disk in drive
Press any key when ready :-(
!No anydrive message!

With bios mod - place system disk in drive, but displays anydrive first

No hdd flash when hdd removed.


DOS 6.22 only shows 76mb 120mb hdd in virtualbox.
I was able to get it to boot but anydisk was still running. it booted on the T2000SXe
However fdisk reported a strange size.
I did fdisk /mbr which killed anydisk
then it would not boot.

Using DOS 7.10 in Virtualbox, fdisk reports 125mb, correct size.
Format c: /s, copy all files to c:. see if it boots in the T2000SXe?
Disk IO error. - T2000Sxe

So anydisk + 6.22 did boot at least once, with the wrong hdd size.
7.10 gives disk error

Retried, ran fdisk /mbr on virtualbox

anydrive attempt
ANYDRIVE 0 842 8 38
Says HDD size is 63MB????
Then reboot, asks for fdd - yes.
Fdisk, recreate (seems identical) then FORMAT
Now shows ANYDRIVE
Disk I.O error
Maybe it doesn't like dos 7.10 argh.

Dos 6.22 shows it as a non dos partition.
Delete partition, create new, format c: /s 76MB
Copy a:*.* c:/dos
Now it says "non system disk or disk error"

With the bios set at 60MB it has the same error.

try booting anydisk then formatting?

anydrive s
OK interestingly anydisk reports "TRACKS" not cylinders 
842 / 8 / 38
155610 sectors = 76 MByte PrecSect 38 (155610 * 512 = 76MByte) Should be 25k sectors...
interesting....
1 cylinder = set of tracks. A track is segments of sectors. A sectors i 512 bytes.

Tried anydrive -> fdisk 25% (20mb partition)
Now it just shows anydrive and a blinking _ char on the T2000SXe

 OK retry with dos 7.1
Fdisk shows 125MB
Create 25% partition 31MB
Format - 19MB ??? how is that possible?
create 100% partition 
format - 19MB ???????
BINGO get anydrive boots to a _, can't press left shift....
format only formats 19MB now wtf
delete partition - anydisk now asks to boot from a
fdisk - create 25% 31MB partition
boot - anydisk left shift works - boot a
format c: /s - - 31.22MB!!!!

On boot anydrive says press any key to boot from a - T2000SXe

Does the same in virtualbox

set active partition 1 - now it boots in virtualbox
T2000SXe - invalid system disk... argh

use 6.22
Boot using left shift anydisk
format c:/s using 6.22
it boots in virtualbox.
T2000SXe - non system disk or disk error... argh

all fdds have failed drive bands.

in virtualbox, it shows invalid media type reading drive c if booted from a
partition shows 20mb in fdisk (not 31MB!)
c says missing operating system, cannot press left shift
format c:/s (no anydisk) & copy to c:/dos
boots c with anydisk now.
With T2000SXe it shows anydisk... _ stuck on _ again
But boots in virtualbox.

@#$%@#%#$
Cannot get T2000SXe to accept the hdd... no idea why


TRY 2GB CF CARD - FAILS

Try fdisk /dev/sdh (CF card)
xpert mode x

Force chs to be 1024 16 63 (likely limit)
c, h, s

r return to main menu
v verify (nothing happens)
p print partition table
d delete partition 1 (no partition selection it just deletes it)
n add a new partition
first sector default 2048 (min 2048) – to 30,000 sectors (17MB)
v verify alarms that there is only a small partition
l, t partition type 6 - FAT16
w write

Boot in virtualbox
Correct size hdd ? no? 13.64MB
shows FAT12 type in fdisk. But shows total disk space 1906MB in dos 6.22
virtualbox won't boot it.
T2000SXe does the blank stare - shows mem information and _ with 504MB setting.
Try 120MB setting for fun.
it really doesn't like this CF card... no dice either. Just bombs
Oh dear.


WORKING 120MB SETUP: Toshiba MK1722FCV

Retry 120MB drive:
Use FDISK to set 842 8 38 - 255967 unallocated 512 byte sectors - correct! (as per above xpert mode)
create partition - defaults (max size) and set type to 6 (n, t) = FAT16
write out

In virtualbox disk
fdisk - shows correctly as 125MByte in dos 6.22!!!
Set to primary partition
Format c: /s (dos 6.22)
formatting 123.98MB... 
try to boot in virtualbox OK (I did not complete time and date, just checked Starting MS-DOS appears)
try in T2000SXe ... SUCCESS - ANYDRIVE shows first, then starting MS-DOS
is anydrive required? 
fdisk /mbr -T2000SXe
No. Starting MS-DOS! no ANYDRIVE.
