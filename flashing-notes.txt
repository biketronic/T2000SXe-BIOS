HOW TO FLASH

Read the Toshiba TC57H1024D-85 as a M27C1024 in TL-866 programmer
uncheck "check ID" as it's not really this chip
Now you have a backup of your BIOS.

To flash the eeprom
(Or Buy a m27c1024-10f1 by ST and keep the original, these are $1 on aliexpress)
Blank check - OK
VPP 12.5V
VDD write 6.25V
Puls Delay 100us
VCC verify 5.00V

Open file .BIN with defaults
Ascii looks like crap - "A.llR gith seResvrde" - this looks the same as the original chip. It's normal.

Press program (takes 30 sec)
Verify - success

Now try and boot T2000SXe with original bios and new M27C1024-10F1
It boots - so the bios is being read successfully from the EEPROM.
