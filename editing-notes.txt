CHECKSUM code
See testing-notes. This has been bypassed.
At: 62F1 
stc - set carry = failed checksum
set 6314 f9->90 to NOP
DONE.
This was definitely required.

Also edited 7960 - jnz memory verify fail - set to nop
7960 153926FFFEBF3975 -> 75 -> 90 = NOP & 796B
DONE.
Not sure if this was required.

Confirmed - BIOS now starts. Without, there is no display of any text on boot or any error message.



HDD detection code
At F:5A04 - Write HDD type

CMOS 35h = detected HDD type 08=not found
CMOS 12h = set HDD type 00 = not set

5A0B If 35h & 0F = 00 NO HDD (not detected)
5A15 If 12h & F0 = 00 NO HDD (not set)
5A1E if 12h & F) <> ch?? NO HDD (assume mismatch detected and set)

So if it doesn't detect a HDD, any change to 12h in the BIOS menu will fail....
There isn't a way to detect "no hdd at all" using existing code?

Propose change:
5A0B : jnz -> NOP (could break something if there really isn't a hdd? - ignore detection)
5A0B: 75 22 -> 90 22
5A15 : jz -> LEAVE (so you can set no HDD)
5A1E : jz -> NOP (ignore mismatch)
5A1E: 74 0E -> 90 0E
DONE.

Expected Result: HDD detection ignored, use BIOS setting.




At F:4B06 - Change HDD setting in BIOS menu

F:4B1F 
xor al.cl - al=(12h & F0), cl = (35h & F0h) (from another routine)
or ch,al - ch = (12h & 0F), al=result
mov 12h, ch - set 12h to result

Say 12h = type 21 & 35h = type 21
xor 20,20 = 00
or 00,00 = 00
mov 12h, 00 - set 

Say 12h = 08 & 35h = 28
xor 00,20 = 20
or 08,20 = 28
mov 12h,28 - set

As long as 12h and 35h contain either 0 or the same hdd type it will swap values.
If 12h or 35h use the second byte it will end up there

say 12h = 20, 35h = 08
xor 20,00 = 20
or 00,20
mov 12h,28 

Hmm seems there is a bug if 12h is not the detected type. But this seems not possible.

Propose change:
4B1f XOR al, cl -> add al, 10h
4B1F: 32 C1 -> 04 10 ? Yes!
DONE.

Expected Result:
Since al = set HDD type it will cycle from 0 through to 15, then overflow to 0.
I think the bios supports 15 types in theory. Limiting it might be difficult?
Could change OR ch,al to AND al, 70 - limit to 7 types for example. NOT DONE.



Display HDD Capacity- BIOS
NOTE: At 437D there are 15 2 byte spaces for HDD sizes displayed by the BIOS when cycling through
Without change there will be lots of zeros.
Currently type 1 changed to "MK"

HDD Cylinders etc for more HDD types
At: E401
Currently type 1 changed.

HDD detection code - 35h
At:5A6D
Attempted to set anther HDD label of a 120MB hdd "MK1722FCV". No detection??
ASCII values & pointers left modified.
