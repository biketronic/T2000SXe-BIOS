Common FDD fault is the drive band has fallen off / become loose and doesn't drive any more
belt is 1.9mm wide
0.5mm thick
black
no teeth
115mm x 2 long = 230mm long max maybe as little as 220mm long as it stretched and doesn't drive any more.
230 = 73mm dia
220 = 70mm dia

230 seems too long.
220 seems too long
180mm seems tight. Works but sounds horrible, won't last long.

Possible replacement part text: try these key words on aliexpress/ebay/etc.
