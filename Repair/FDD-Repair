Common FDD fault is the drive band has fallen off / become loose and doesn't drive any more
belt is 1.9mm wide
0.5mm thick
black
no teeth
115mm x 2 long = 230mm long max maybe as little as 220mm long as it stretched and doesn't drive any more.
230 = 73mm dia
220 = 70mm dia

230 seems too long.
220 seems too long - doesn't work.
200 = ? do not have one to try
180mm seems tight. Works but sounds horrible as the motor scrapes the bottom. Loosened a screw and it is now quiet.

Possible replacement part text: try these key words on aliexpress/ebay/etc.
The following material was tried above- looks thicker than the original belt, up to twice as thick, but 2mm wide looks the same.
